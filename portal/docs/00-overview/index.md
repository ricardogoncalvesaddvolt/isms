Welcome to the Information Security Management System (ISMS) space. This site serves as the **single source of truth** for our security documentation, providing a centralized repository that aligns with ISO/IEC 27001 and related standards.

This portal is organized into four key sections to guide users through our governance framework and operational practices:

## Policies
Our policies define the high-level requirements and directives for information security across the organization. They establish the “what” — guiding principles and mandates that align with ISO/IEC 27001 and other relevant standards.

## Standards
The standards section provides direct access to applicable international standards and mappings, including control mappings and the Statement of Applicability (SoA). This ensures clear visibility into requirements and their organizational applicability.

## Procedures (SOPs)
Standard Operating Procedures document the detailed steps and processes — the “how” — to implement and maintain security controls consistently and effectively, ensuring operational repeatability and accountability.

## Evidence
The evidence register catalogs immutable records, audit artifacts, and references that demonstrate compliance with policies, procedures, and controls. It supports ongoing verification and audit readiness.
